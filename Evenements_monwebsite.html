                    With the idea of imparting programming 
                    knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT 
                    Roorkee alumnus started a dream, 
                    GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming 
                    excites you or you feel stifled, 
                    wondering how to prepare for 
                    interview questions or
                    how to ace data structures and 
                    algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a 
                    one-stop solution. With every 
                    tick of time, we are adding arrows 
                    in our quiver. From articles on 
                    various computer science subjects 
                    to programming problems for practice,
                    from basic to premium courses, from 
                    technologies to entrance examinations, 
                    we have been building ample content 
                    with superior quality. In a short 
                    span, we have built a community of 
                    1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
                    Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors 
                    in various colleges across the nation. 
                    Our success stories include a lot of 
                    students who benefitted in their 
                    placements and landed jobs at tech 
                    giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
                    network of geeks and we are only a 
                    fraction of it yet.
